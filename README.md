# Senior Web Engineer - Coding Challenge

Welcome! As the next step in our interview process, we have a short, practical coding challenge. We expect this to take around **2 hours**.

## Important Guidelines

**The goal is not necessarily to finish every feature.** We are most interested in seeing your approach to problem-solving, your coding style, architectural decisions, and production-readiness considerations. A well-structured, partially complete solution with tests and documentation is better than a rushed, fully complete one.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (LTS version recommended)
- Your preferred package manager (npm, yarn, pnpm, etc.)
- Any development tools you're comfortable with

## Choose One Challenge

Please select **ONE** of the following three challenges:

### Option 1: [Facility Search API](facility-search-api/)
Build a RESTful API for searching and filtering fitness facilities. Tests API design, data handling, validation, error handling, and testing practices.

### Option 2: [Health Onboarding Form](health-onboarding-form/)
Build a multi-step registration form for new gym members. Tests React component architecture, state management, form handling, validation, and UX decisions.

### Option 3: [Facility Check-In PWA](facility-checkin-pwa/)
Build a mobile-responsive web app for members to check in at facilities via barcode/QR code. Tests full-stack thinking, mobile UX, state management, and PWA capabilities.

## What's Provided

Each challenge folder contains:
- A **README.md** with high-level requirements
- An **assets/** folder with necessary data files and utilities
- Mock authentication utilities (where relevant)

## Technical Freedom

You have complete freedom to:
- Choose your preferred frameworks and libraries
- Structure your code however you see fit
- Add any additional tooling (linting, formatting, testing, etc.)
- Make architectural decisions based on your experience

**Be prepared to discuss why you made these choices in the follow-up interview.**

## Use of AI Tools

We're an AI-first company, and you're welcome to use AI coding assistants (GitHub Copilot, Claude, ChatGPT, etc.) to help you complete this challenge. However, **you must be able to explain every line of code and every decision as if it's 2022 and you wrote it all yourself.**

In the follow-up interview, we'll ask you to walk through your solution and discuss:
- Why you structured the code the way you did
- How specific parts of your implementation work
- Trade-offs you considered
- Alternative approaches you might have taken

If you use AI tools, treat them as pair programming partners - understand and own the code they generate.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/FitnessPassport/fp-web-challenge.git
   cd fp-web-challenge
   ```

2. Choose one challenge folder (`facility-search-api`, `health-onboarding-form`, or `facility-checkin-pwa`)

3. Follow the detailed instructions in that challenge's **README.md**

## Submission

When you're ready to submit:
1. Ensure your code is well-structured and includes comments where helpful
2. Include any additional setup instructions if needed
3. Submit your solution by either:
   - Sharing a link to a public GitHub repository, or
   - Zipping up your project folder and emailing it back to us

**Good luck, and we look forward to seeing what you build!**
