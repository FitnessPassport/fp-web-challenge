# Facility Check-In PWA - Coding Challenge

## Overview

Build a mobile-responsive web application that allows gym members to check in at facilities using a barcode or QR code.

**What is a check-in?** When a member arrives at a gym or fitness facility, they scan a QR code (or enter a facility code) to register their presence. This records that they're at the facility and allows them access. After checking in, members should see a confirmation screen that they can show to facility staff if needed.

This challenge is designed to be completed within **2 hours** and focuses on mobile UX, state management, barcode handling, and Progressive Web App capabilities.

**Important:** The goal is not necessarily to finish every feature. We are most interested in seeing your problem-solving approach, mobile UX decisions, state management strategy, and how you think about building app-like web experiences. A well-structured solution with good mobile UX is better than a feature-complete but poorly designed one.

## Provided Assets

- `assets/facilities.json` - Facility data with IDs that match barcode/QR codes
- `assets/current-user.json` - Mock logged-in user data
- `assets/auth.ts` - Mock authentication utilities
- `assets/sample-qr-code.png` - Sample QR code image for testing (contains facility ID)

## Requirements

Build a web app that allows users to check in at fitness facilities by scanning a barcode or QR code. Consider:
- How will users scan or input facility codes?
- What happens during a check-in?
- How will you track check-in state?
- What feedback should users receive?
- How should the app work on mobile devices?
- Should it work offline?

## What We're Looking For

We'll be evaluating your approach to problem-solving, code quality, and how you think about production systems.

## Technical Requirements

- Use **React** with **TypeScript**
- **Mobile-first** responsive design
- Build this however you would approach it in a real project

You have complete freedom to choose frameworks, libraries, tools, and project structure.

## Getting Started

1. Review the provided assets
2. Plan your check-in flow and user experience
3. Set up your project with your preferred tools
4. Build your solution
5. Test on mobile (or mobile viewport)
6. Document your approach

## Submission

When you're ready to submit:

1. Include any documentation necessary to run and understand your solution
2. Submit by either:
   - Sharing a link to a public GitHub repository, or
   - Zipping up your project folder and emailing it back to us

Good luck! We look forward to seeing what you build.
