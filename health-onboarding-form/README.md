# Health Onboarding Form - Coding Challenge

## Overview

Build a multi-step registration form for new gym members. Users need to provide information across multiple steps before completing their signup. This challenge is designed to be completed within **2 hours** and focuses on React component architecture, state management, form handling, validation, and user experience.

**Important:** The goal is not necessarily to finish every feature. We are most interested in seeing your approach to state management, component design, form validation, and how you think about user experience. A well-structured solution with good UX is better than a feature-complete but poorly organized one.

## Provided Assets

- `assets/auth.ts` - Mock authentication utilities
- `assets/membership-tiers.json` - Available membership options
- `assets/health-conditions.json` - Sample health conditions list

## Requirements

Build a multi-step registration workflow for gym membership signup. Consider:
- What information needs to be collected?
- How should the form be broken into steps?
- How will you manage state across steps?
- How will you validate user input?
- How should users navigate between steps?
- What happens when the form is submitted?

## What We're Looking For

We'll be evaluating your approach to problem-solving, code quality, and how you think about production systems.

## Technical Requirements

- Use **React** with **TypeScript**
- Build this however you would approach it in a real project

You have complete freedom to choose frameworks, libraries, tools, and project structure.

## Getting Started

1. Review the provided assets
2. Plan your form steps and data collection
3. Set up your project with your preferred tools
4. Build your solution
5. Document your approach

## Submission

When you're ready to submit:

1. Include any documentation necessary to run and understand your solution
2. Submit by either:
   - Sharing a link to a public GitHub repository, or
   - Zipping up your project folder and emailing it back to us

Good luck! We look forward to seeing what you build.
